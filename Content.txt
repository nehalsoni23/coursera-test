Going into the directory where we want to store our created files type following command in cmd :
atom .
This will automatically create directory structure in atom and by right clicking on it, select New File which will create new file for us in that folder
only.
After creating file to show it on browser with BrowserSynce type below command :
browser-sync start --server --directory --files "**/*"
--server means server mode which means I want to serve up all the files in a particular directory and --directory means if there is nothing in
that directory and it can't find index.html, it will still display a webpage with basically a directory structure that it sees.
--files means we want to tell browser-sync which files to watch for changes if any of those files changes. By "**/*", we say that we want any
directory and whatever directory you'll find. we want any file inside of the directory, thats '*'.
git status -> will show uncommitted files as red. For adding files -> git add . (. means anything in this directory and any subdirectory)
After that git status will show files with green colors

To commit the files in git
git commit -m "First web files" -> -m is flag to specify a message with our commit and that's required.
Before committing into github first we have to provide credentials with given commands.
After committing we have to write "git push" to make available remotely I guess.
